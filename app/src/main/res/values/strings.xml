    <string name="encryption_desc">Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It uses algorithms to transform readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext). Only those with the correct decryption key can access the original information.</string>

    <string name="sample_features">The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe to secure data. Established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001, AES is a robust and efficient encryption standard that replaced the older Data Encryption Standard (DES).

Features:

1. Symmetric Encryption: AES uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making key management crucial.  Both parties must securely share and store the key.
2 Block Cipher: AES processes data in fixed-size blocks of 128 bits. If the data exceeds this size, it is divided into multiple blocks.
3. Key Sizes: AES supports three key lengths: 128, 192, and 256 bits. Longer keys offer higher security but may require more processing power.
4. Structure: AES operates through a series of rounds, involving substitutions, permutations, and mixing of the input data. The number of rounds varies by key length:
10 rounds for 128-bit keys
12 rounds for 192-bit keys
14 rounds for 256-bit keys
5. Efficiency: AES is designed for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for both hardware and software implementations.</string>
